An app to show all the F1 Race information

# My views and strategies
## Frotend
Used ES6,Webpack,Reactjs and Reduxjs for this project. On Using Reduxjs, avoided mutable updates to the data. Also made a good minimalist UI design. Used CSS3 Flexbox module like sticky footer and for other usage.
Throughout the project, respected errors (i.e properly showing) and showing spinners wherever is necessary.
